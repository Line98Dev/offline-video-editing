### Adding a Video

To add a video to a playlist navigate into the playlist by clicking "Edit Playlist" then click the "Add Videos" button at the bottom of the screen.
Once you click this button a file picker will open, allowing you to select one or several videos that are downloaded onto your computer.
Our example shows the Windows file picker, but it should look similar on other platforms.

Once you select your videos in the file picker hit "Open" and then the videos will load into the playlist with a preview of the video and the video name. (Note this may take some time if you are loading large videos)

### Clipping a Video

To click a video first navigate to the video viewing window for the video you want to clip.
[Previewing a Video](#Viewing-a-Video)

Once in the video viewing window, in the video player move the video time to the start point of where you would like the clip to begin.
Then click the "Set Start Time" button. You will see a time stamp appear on the screen beneath the test "Start Time".
Then move the video time to where you want the video clip to end and click "Set End Time", this will then set the time stamp for the end time of your clip.

Once you have set both the Start and End time click the "Clip Video" button and then navigate back a screen to the playlist contents screen.

![App Icon](https://github.com/Line98Dev/offline-video-editing/blob/master/Auxiliary%20Files/UWP%20User/ClipTimesSet.png)

You should now see a new video inside of your playlist. There will be the original video that you just took a clip from, and then the clip itself.
This clip will appear with the same file name with clip# appended to the end of it. We preserve the original video so that you can take as many clips as you would like from the original video.

![App Icon](https://github.com/Line98Dev/offline-video-editing/blob/master/Auxiliary%20Files/UWP%20User/ClipMade.png)

Each new clip will follow the same name pattern with the number at the end of clip going up one for each clip.

### Uploading a Playlist

Once you have made as many video clips as you want, and added all your videos, you can click the "Upload Videos" button that is at the bottom of the window.
This will send your playlist to the Zooom servers under your account and will allow you to then view and share the playlist you made on the Zooom Web App.
Keep in mind that the process of uploading the videos still may take some time, but you do not have to have the Zooom website open for it to finish.

### Navigating Pages

To navigate between pages click the button that corresponds with the page you want to go to. If you want to go back a page, in the top right corner of each page is a "Go back" button that will take you back one page.
So for example if you are in the video player page for a video clicking go back will take you to the playlist page that the video is in. Clicking go back again will then take you to the Playlists page that shows all playlists.
