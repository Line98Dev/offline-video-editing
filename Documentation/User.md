Once logged in to the application you will see this screen. This is the Playlists view screen which will show a full list of all playlists you have created on your local device. Click the "Create a new playlist" button to add a new playlist to this screen.
    <table>
      <tr>
         <td>Mobile</td>
         <td>Desktop</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td> <img src="https://github.com/Line98Dev/offline-video-editing/blob/master/Auxiliary%20Files/Android-EmptyPlaylistView.jpg" height="300"></td>

      </tr>
    </table>
    
You can edit a playlist by clicking next to the "Edit Playlist" button that is next to the playlist you want to modify.
    <table>
      <tr>
         <td>Mobile</td>
         <td>Desktop</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td> <img src="" height="300"></td>
         <td><img src="" height="300"></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    
This screen is internal contents of your playlist. Once added a list of videos that are included in the playlist will show here.
    <table>
      <tr>
         <td>Mobile</td>
         <td>Desktop</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td> <img src="" height="300"></td>
         <td><img src="" height="300"></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    
Clicking the "Edit the Information" button will bring up a information screen that allows you to edit the information that represents the videos in the playlist.
    <table>
      <tr>
         <td>Mobile</td>
         <td>Desktop</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td> <img src="" height="300"></td>
         <td><img src="" height="300"></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    
Clicking the "Add a Video" button will pull up a file picker from which to select the media file you want to add to your playlist. On desktop you can select multiple files at a time, mobile however only allows for a single file to be selected at a time.

         <td><img src="" height="300"></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    
Clicking the "Upload Videos" button will upload the entire playlist to the Zooom website.
