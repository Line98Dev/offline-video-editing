# Project Description

## Summary

- Analyze the existing system to check if offline is possible/feasible
- Add/remove/ metadata to a video offline and integrate it to your system.
- Xamarin-based cross-platform.
- We have an existing video application built on the Azure platform. We receive a lot of feedback from users that they would like a way to edit and view video offline. In our existing web/mobile application users are able to draw on videos, add voice notes, add text on the video player screen. I would like to create a way for users to create these same types of "edits" prior to uploading the video, offline, then have all the edits upload with the video.
- I would also like a way for users to be able to view the videos offline without an internet connection. This would also include the ability for users to embed our videos, for offline viewing, in things like PowerPoints and documents, etc.
