Going over what we were told by the Ergin with the client
Overview from Kylon on how he started and got into Zoom
A sports official learns to official through video review 
Historically coaches record games and burn DVD’s then officials would try and get copies.
Break-down video: to edit it for officiating learning purposes
Draw on the screen
Audio notes on the video based on time 
Text notes on the screen
Clip sections of video for the parts that are important to review
Average age for officials is 55 years old.
Practical application of all of this is that officials will be break down videos and then sharing it with other officials
Mentors who will give feedback on their analysis
State organizations putting things into highlight and training reels
Problems
They want an easier editing system.
Right now a whole video has to be edited and uploaded, sometimes that’s a 3+ hour long game.
Game will be sent as a downloadable file and then needs to be uploaded to the system for editing. This takes extra time.
Get the file, download it to the machine, then edit directly on the machine.
It could take hours for a video to be uploaded and edited.
Client imagines this to be fixed by some sort of software packet that is downloaded to the machine so that a user can do all of those features offline.
Ex. when clipped on local machine then only the clipped sections are saved and the extra large parts of the file get thrown out.
Big thing to solve is the time problem of uploading huge files
Many users for 20 years have gone to in person meetings to study these videos
Many of them have built powerpoints as a result of this for teaching
They want to be able to integrate power points with these videos that they have made.
Once the video is on the online system and is shared with another user or group, people may want to then integrate the video with the powerpoint, and need to be able to view that video offline and then embed it into the powerpoint.
For this being in a powerpoint, do we want to still have the clips inside of large clip feature?
What kyle envisions is that a three hour video will never really exist, only the ten second segments.
For embedding offline it will somehow take the ten different files and organize them into a playlist.
When file number one plays then it’ll just roll to the next video in the playlist.

Company information:
Eastern time (located in Indy)
People we can communicate with
Kyle is our Main contact
Auri will be brought in when we get into the tech area, he’s very busy. (backend person)
Lane (Developer front end)
Dyllan (Dev front end)

Can we get access to the product:
We can be set up with access by Kyle from a user standpoint.
Backend access will be from Auri at a later date.

Any existing documentation for Azure side
Auri would know but Kyle can get us this information.
Azure is the backbone for database, media delivery, etc.
Uses .net
Offline access is built into azure 
Mobile apps are all built in Xamarin
Media player is in HTML 5

Visual style guides
Kyle has a branding kit for us 
We want everything to look as similar to the current platform as possible.

Can we package what is currently online just to be offline?

There is an offline uploader that they use.

If we can add sharing options to the offline portal awesome but officially out of scope.

Ideally this will be across all platform. Xamarin for everything except for Mac which would have to be a IOS platform. We want this to be on all platforms.

Freedcamp for project management 
This is where we will interact with Auri

Challenge figuring out how to take the metadata from the site and integrate it with the video both offline and online.

Edit before we upload question:
Each of the clips from one video that a ref makes offline should be done like how the fyre uploader works. Where each one of the videos are assembled into a playlist.


Big goal with offline and embed
Video with the metadata that sits on top so that it can be viewed offline
When you download videos currently the meta data doesn’t came with 

Right now the reason the video cannot be viewed offline edited
Corkboard and each video frame is a single image on the corkboard. Then the edits that you make is like putting a plexiglass layer on top. It’s not baked into the video ever.
Part of the system allows you to submit videos into a library, if you’ve drawn on the video someone can copy that video with all of the drawings and edit them. In a perfect world this will continue to happen offline as well. But right now we expect mashed together video with no editing to be what is available for download.
