## Topics Discussed

- Showed off software and documentation for this iteration to Kyle
  - showed off both windows and android, clarified it could also run on IOS
  - stated that for the following iterations we will need access to an apple developer account for better testing (Hunter will send an email with details)
- Kyle agreed that as the project is currently it is in a functioning and usable state that could be rolled out
  - we clarified there are some details that will get modified along in the next iteration so the current upload process will not stay completely the same
- Went over Iteration 3 chosen feature of Clippling
  - explained why we chose this as our next crucial feature
  - Kyle went on a brief tanget asking about a new potential feature on multiple playlist merging
    - premise is that if I have playlist A and playlist B with the files named as 1, 2, 3, could we be able to merge them together to watch them in order of 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B
    - we mentioned to him although we do not currently have any plans for a automatic merge feature of this type we will make note of it for future considerations if we make it through all our other previously agreed upon feature
    - additionally as the app will be now this can be completed manually by uploading the vidos into one single playlist and manually re-ordinging them.
      - From this we considered that we should probably ensure that when videos are added to a playlist they should probably auto sort based on the title name, or at least give the user the optin of this.
- Mentioned to Kyle that today was the last official day of the semester and that we will not "officially" be working on this project over break, but due to deadlines that resume after the 18th of January some work may be done, and limited communication may be needed over the break as a result.




## Things Clarified
- Hunter will send out an email later today to Auri and Kyle asking for apple and google play dev account access
