## Topics Discussed
- Talked about our current progress on the app, what has been added since Austin last saw it
- Covered emergency email thread we had with Kyle over the existing app (not under our control) breaking due to Windows updates issues
- Talked about current major roadblocks with clipping feature for this iteration
  - We know we need to encode the video but doing so isn't something that seems to have been done already for cross platform
  - we could currently choose just one platform and at the very least get one working
  - Austin suggested that UWP should be our focus since there are problems with the existing UWP app meaning it will need a replacement as soon as possible.
  - We may have to implement interfaces for the different encoding libarires we will have to use.
- Iteration 5 goals discussion
  - where we're at right now our current goal of clipping may spill over into iteration 5 more considerably than we previously though
  - get all lingering clipping related features done is the primary goal for the end of iteration 5
  - better UI design that matches our original mockups and the site better.
- Feeback on documentation
 - needs to be better formatted, it's hard to navigate (we got similar feedback from Ergin during iteration day)

    
## Things Clarified
- Austin will look into clipping videos programmatically more, by any means
- Jaden will be working on the UI tonight and tomorrow before out team meeting at 7
- Hunter and Sam will be working more before the meeting tomorrow on the Moq library set up
- Jacob will be working through the remaining week on encoding libraries
