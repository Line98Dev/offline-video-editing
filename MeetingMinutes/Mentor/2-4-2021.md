## Topics Discussed
- Show off app since it was last shown to Austin
- Show bug with buttons having a small cooldown time
  - Austin suggested that it may be because it's waiting for a return of the thread that is clearing playlists.
- We can't tag a release quite like Ergin wants us to since things work differently on DevOps than it does in Github
  - We tried anyways and we got an error saying we do not have permissions to do so
  - we need to let Ergin know about this in presentation

## Things Clarified
- Update presentation to make note of pipeline problem
