## Topics Discussed

- Jaden Hunter, working on getting the update problems fixed
- Sam, working on solution to testing roadblcok we have had due to asynchronous functions
- Jacob, researching code possibilities for clippig videos
- By the end of the meeting we were unable to resolve the problem with the updates so we drafted an email to Auri, Ergin, and Austin, to inform them of the issues.
