- [ ] UC-3: Better mobile application use

	* The reason that this is a Use Case is because the mobile application on both iOS and Android are not that great. On iOS, there is basically no app. The menu is blacked out but there are still buttons that log you off or there is an about page. For android it is just a copy of the desktop application, which runs poorly.

	* All Actors are linked to the Use Case

	* Let's say that you want to look at a video that you uploaded to the desktop version of the application and you want to view it on your phone. I would be able to look at the video on the app and be able to use the same tools as the desktop version. Also, I can view the videos offline so that I am always able to review a video. Lastly, the menu on the app should be able to navigate cleanly and has a nice look.

- [ ] UC-4: Adding Survey to a clip

	* This is a Use Case because this goes along with one of the requirements of our application. Another reason is because it could be completed as its own requirement during the development of the application.
