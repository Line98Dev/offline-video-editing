# Business Requirements

1. __BR1__
    *  We want to allow users to use the editing features of our current platform (telestrations, audio overlay, etc.) offline
    *  This is a business requirement because one of the current issues that users have with the Zooom platform is that they must have an internet connection in order to use it. If users are in an area where the wifi is poor or non-existent they are unable to complete any work. 
    
2. __BR2__
    *  Reduce overall video size, so that when a video is uploaded to the server it takes less time.
    *  If a user has a video of an entire game that they wish to edit they have to upload the entire file to the Zooom servers before editing. Depending on the file size this can take a very long time. Since one of the editing tools is the ability to “clip” videos to make them shorter, doing so offline would allow for smaller videos and a shorter upload time since the user will only be uploading the shortened clipped video.
    
3. __BR3__
    *  Application must visually resemble current online application
    *  The client expressed that much of the work that they’ve had to do with their clients is the hard transition to technology in the first place. Many of the clients are deemed as not being tech savvy and the current platform has been carefully designed so that it works in an understandable way for them. We need to keep the new system as visually similar as possible so that users don’t have to re-learn a new platform entirely to do the same functions they are currently doing.
    
4. __BR4__
    *  Create a video format so that users can play it offline.
    *  Many of the clients have expressed that they would like the ability to play the videos offline when they’re on fields, or in classrooms without stable interest connections. Currently the videos are only playable if you have a connection to the Zooom website.

5. __BR5__
    * Users can tag videos with either pre-definied or user generated tags to allow the ability to search and improve the overall search functionality.
